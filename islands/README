In Scotese runs, modern barotropic streamfunction looks very odd -  massive values over Antarctica (teyda).

draw_islands script:
~swsvalde/ummodel/scripts/draw_islands -dump dump@da 

make_bath_islands script:
~ggdjl/ggdjl/um/scripts/make_bath_islands_new dump@da bath.nc islands.nc

To run isla:
module load isla/1.0.1
Help -> Contents
File -> Load land-sea mask
e.g. omask_stand.nc
File -> Import island comparison data
e.g. standard.ocean.ver01

Looks like islands defined by Isla are offset from those in the standard preindustrial file in the plot.  May be OK in the output data.

Made a set of islands for the mdoern lsm for the same islands as in the default Met Office version.

In xancil, try to create a new ocean dump with the islands from isla.
xancil -> Confguration -> Ancillary files to create -> Ocean dump file
          Dump Files -> Ocean Start Dump -> Use data from UM start dump
          Dump Files -> Ocean Start Dump -> Modify islands data / Replace
          Dump Files -> Ocean Start Dump -> Input dat file name [file from isla]
xancil -> Creat Anc Files

This produces a file that, when run back through bath_islands_scr, is offset.
Conclusion: xancil works well with the island file.
Conclusion: isla isn't working correctly.

**Plan:**
(1) Use bath_islands_scr to identify and modify islands, and modify bath_islands scr so that it writes out a file that is compatible with xancil (same format as output from isla).  Test with standard and simulation 1 and simulation N.

(2) Carry out a continuation of two of Paul's simulations, with modified islands (simulation 1 and simulation N).


WORKFLOW

(1) mkdir EXP
(2) cp ~swsvalde/ummodel/data/EXP/expt_archive  EXP and untaz and extract ocean restart.
(3) cp ~swsvalde/ummodel/data/EXP/inidata/omask_EXP.nc EXP
(3a) bath_islands_scr tEydeo#da000003850c1+ bath_tEyde.nc islands_tEyde.nc islands_tEyde_ascii
(4) isla restart file, consolidate/remove, and output text file [islands_tEyde_isla].
(5) add one to end points (2nd and 4th elements) [islands_tEyde_isla_corr].
(6) xancil
(7) bath_islands_scr tEydeo#da000003850c1+_newislands bath_tEyde_newislands.nc islands_tEyde_newislands.nc islands_tEyde_newislands_ascii
(8) ferret/xconv  islands_tEyde_newislands.nc to check


BUGS/FEATURES OF ISLA:
(1) Does not always draw boxes around islands.  See e.g. tEyde.
(2) Island segments are offset wrt Met office kosher islands in HadCM3L.
(3) File system searches for *.* so misses files without a dot.
(4) Treats some islands as separate, even if they are continuous on the u/v grid

email from PJV:

It was my mistake. I accidentally deleted it and didn't remake it. One
of the problems with using a single executable for everything is that
the parexe files are all created in the same folder as the
executable. I ended up with several 1000 such files and started having
problems because the names were being repeated. I meant to delete all
of the parexe files but unfortunately typed *exeâ€‹* and deleted the
executable. I recreated the 03 executable but not the 02 because it
has largely been superseded. For some ensembles, I have started using
a symlink in $DATAW to the "standard" executable. This has to be done
manually but has the benefit that the parexe files stay in DATAW

The difference between the 02 and 03 executable is very minor. In
preparing the new version of the model, I noticed that the two of the
options to produce faster but not bit reproducible code (section 70
and section 90) actually slowed it down! I assume modern compilers are
better than hand tuning of code (typically, the latter involved
creating vector loops but which required more calculation).

teyd and teye differ because of the executbale and the changes in
diffusion parameters which makes HadCM3L nearer to HadCM3. I also
reduced the water fix timescale to 50 years (cf. 20 years in original
code) and limiting the minimum salinity to 10PSU rather than 0PSU. The
latter change is somewhat arbitrary and for relatively little reason
but was motivated because the model is representing ocean, not lakes,
so I don't really expect it ever to become truly fresh. I based it on
10 PSU because that is the salinity of the Baltic today.

On the whole, I see the teyd series as a stepping stone towards the
teye series and suspect that teyd will not be used in anger (or
published). The changes in ocean diffusion further improves the
high-latitudes and I cannot imagine wanting to go back to the older,
teyd, settings. So it is fine to check the islands in teyd but would
recommend using teye for the next set of long runs.

####### QUESTIONS FOR PJV

# See ISLA 'features' above.

# WHY IN MAKE_JOBS SCRIPT IS ISLAND = "Y1" and not "Y"
#   As a result, all jobs have "l_oislands=.true.", and 1 island defined.

# IN BC4, teyd restarts are in /mnt/storage/home/ggdjl/dump2hold/dumps_deeptime/teyd
#   and labelled 000005850c1+, but files from expt_archive are 000003850c1+

# In Scotese runs, modern barotropic streamfunction looks very odd -  massive values over Antarctica (teyda).

# Can Isla run in script mode?

OK, now try with stationary ocean and no land-sea mask in ocean u,v.
Seems to work OK! 

OK, now try with all variables expanded (fillmiss).
Seems to work OK! [may some gridpoint noise in v variable at poles - see pf files?]

OK, now try with a modified bathymetry....
\cp /home/bridge/ggpjv/working/oil/scotese/output/541_0_1deg_02o.nc .
ncks -v depthmask_xancil 541_0_1deg_02o.nc 541_0_1deg_02o_mask.nc
and for 000


----
To try:
*) single row at north pole
*) headers for "pole-is-island"

2 rows at North Pole worked!!  See tfhab, tfhac
tfhab starts with stationary ocean, and new land-sea mask.
tfhac is the new run with islands.

----

OK, final (hopefully!) version with islands, starting from teye series.
